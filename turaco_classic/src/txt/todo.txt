
To do for future versions:  (in no particular order.)
--------------------------

Gui Objects:

->  bitmaped.c object:
     re-write the draw, grid, and mouse placement routines to all
     use the same method for determining pixel placement.
     (so we can get rid of the 32x32+ hack in there now of resizing the grid)
     ** DONE for 1.1.1 **

->  bmpdisp.c object:
     Grid snap & display(?)

Functionality:

->  text field for palettes

->  map editor

->  superbitmap editor

->  fruit path editor

->  port text editor 

->  get everything working at multiple screen resolutions
    - scale the gui gadgets and position appropriately

->  scratchpad editor

->  Gameboy driver (multigame driver)
    - [file]->[load game]->[mame driver] (current)
      [file]->[load game]->[multi driver] (new)
    - brings up a list of multi-driver files: ie gameboy, 2600VCS, NES, etc
    - new ini file format which uses a single gfxbank description, with
      multiple SELECTABLE romsets

->  Atari 2600/VCS driver  -- scrap!
    - need a new menu option
    - need a file selector
    - need a filename / lookup table (time consuming!)
