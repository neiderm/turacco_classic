
for building Turaco, you'll need:

Special instructions for degui...
A) make a directory for DEGUI, and unzip the distribution into it
B) copy over "degui.mak" into the source directory in the degui distribution
   from the txt directory of this distribution
C) rename that "degui.mak" to "makefile", (backup the old makefile if you want)
D) run the "makeall" batch file, to build degui
E) copy the degui.h file into djgpp\include
F) copy the libdegui.a file into djgpp\lib
G) Now you can build Turaco!

if you don't want to use degui, or if you have problems with it:
A) change the two commented lines in the makefile to not use degui.
B) build Turaco.
