
Bug 01:  * FIXED *
    write to bank 3 pacman, change to bank 4
    - fixed by Ivan 0.03

Bug 02:  * FIXED *
    failed load of a driver leaves system in a bad state

Bug 03:  * FIXED *
    load a driver with 2 palettes - one 4 color, one > 4 color.
    if 4 color is first, palette is screwed up when changing.

Bug 04:  * FIXED *
    encode() was not saving out the proper colors, so they got offset by 1
    with each call to encode(), which happens on a bank change.

Bug 05:  * FIXED *
    start turaco with no command line args
    load in pacman
    load in commando
    *crash* (not in fileio.c or drivsel.c!)
    NOTE: this does NOT happen if you specify pacman on the command line
    It was the fileselector.  Something odd with mallocing certain sizes.
    Sound familiar? -ugh-

Bug 06:  * FIXED *
    Games with graphics banks that have different number of planes have 
    problems saving the palette info as the index into the set of palettes 
    for the current plane is used as a index in the ini file. This will 
    overwrite palettes from a different plane. 
    All palettes are now saved in order to avoid this problem.

Bug 07:  * FIXED *
    changes made to a sprite are not committed to the rom data internally
    when the graphics are saved.  
    load pacman, change gfx, save - changes not saved
    change bank, change bank back, save - works
    fixed for 1.0.1

Bug 08:  * FIXED *
    Application of patches doesn't work -- it is not implemented.  oops.
    fixed for 1.1

Bug 09: 
    going to the preferences dialog and exiting, rotates the image 45 degrees
    clockwise.  Odd, eh?
    - temporary workaround added - before we run the dialog, we save the edit
    image to a temporary buffer, then restore it when the dialog is closed.

Bug 10:  * FIXED *
    Ghouls & Ghosts won't load properly -- rom sizes are very large negative
    numbers.  -- as it turns out, Ivan found that there's a flag in the 
    high bit of the number (which causes the large negative numbers) meaning
    to load the roms a certain way.  
    fixed for 1.1.2
