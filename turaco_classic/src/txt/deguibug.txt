Things that degui does not handle properly:

what should happen:
    Menus have \t in the string-> anything after it is right justified
What does happen:
    the \t gets eaten, then the rest of the string does NOT get r.j.

radio buttons do not work as expected

Sliders do not have a 3-d look

text boxes do not use a 3-d slider

listboxes (like used in the file selector) do not display the bottom-most line.
